ssh-keygen -R 192.168.10.20


1) Best and simplest — SSH local port forwarding (no browser on server)

Do this from your workstation (where you have a browser).

From your workstation open an SSH tunnel to the server:

ssh -L 1455:localhost:1455 root@your-server-ip


In the same SSH session on the server run the CLI that starts the local callback listener:

codex login
# or codex login --device-auth if using device flow (whatever command starts the auth listener)


The CLI will print a URL like http://localhost:1455/auth/callback?.... Copy that URL and open it in your workstation browser (not the server). The browser request to http://localhost:1455 will be forwarded over the SSH tunnel to the listener on the server. Complete the sign-in in your browser. Done.
