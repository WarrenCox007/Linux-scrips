# Notes index

This folder breaks the original `Notes` file into focused, runnable snippets:

- `opencode_install.sh` — loads your shell config and installs the Opencode bundle.
- `ssh_access_setup.sh` — fetches and runs the SSH access configuration helper.
- `ssh_key_cleanup.md` — reminder for removing old host keys before reconnecting.
- `user_management.md` — quick reference for adding a sudo-capable user.
- `node20_and_gemini_install.sh` — cleans up Node, installs Node.js 20, and installs the Gemini CLI.

Make the scripts executable before running them, for example:

```bash
chmod +x notes/*.sh
```
